## JDBC - Train Database (IRCTC)

`IRCTC` is a local database I created on my local system. It a sample and very short database I created to run some basic commands in the JVM / JRE.

The current JDBC runs on `JRE-1.8`.

I imported the `mysql-connector` jar file to use all the required classes. The classpath of the library is set accordingly.
